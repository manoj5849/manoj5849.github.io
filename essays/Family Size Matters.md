  In this modern world, when the parents think about starting a family, they have one question in mind, is it easy to live with more than two children? Because of the busy life and rising prices, having a big family is an extremely difficult challenge. To deal with this challenge parents should choose to have fewer children because having one or two children is beneficial to the family and the world.
 
 Inflation is the biggest problem for most of the families. “Because of inflation, Families have been forced to lower their standards of living by forcing out luxuries out of their budget” (Pete, 2013). In a bigger family, with rising price, it is hard to fulfill the daily needs of the whole family. By controlling the size of the family, one can easily manage the monthly expenses such as rent, housing and grocery. Living cost is less so parents can easily invest in the future and save for the rainy days. It is easily possible to save with the small family. With that, parents can spend money on the luxuries, such as long vacations or weekend picnics and make memories with their children. Education plays a vital role in this competitive world to survive and parents can afford this indispensable tool for their children. They can send them to the best schools or universities. Yield the cost of classes such as music or sports, which can help them develop in particular area.
 
 Small family is an environmentally choice as well. Family size and population plays vital role in restraining climate change. “Given that, An American chooses to be fuel efficient and energy efficient and does not have children, he would save more than 500 tons of CO2, huge boon to the environment and top of that contributes to anti population explosion. This shows how having no to less children would benefit this world” (Oliver, 2013). It will put less pressure on environment, reduce food waste, spewing less chemical and increase recycling. According to The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, “10% world population were suffering from the chronic undernourishment, this number can be reduced by the controlling birthdate” (World Hunger Education Service, 2016).
 
 Lastly, Overpopulation influences unemployment. With growing population and education ratio among the people, creates the imbalance between the supply and demand of the jobs, which lead to scarcity of jobs. Having less population density creates better job opportunity for everybody and beneficial for the economic growth of the country. When the population decreases, Employment ratio goes up, standard of living increases, government will have less burden as well.
 
 Therefore having a less number of people in family can benefit everybody and save the environment at the same time. As its leads to better job opportunities, economic development and puts less stress on the scarce resources available to us.
